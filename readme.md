### What is PGV100-F200
From its official documentation:
> The PGVâ€¦ reader forms part of the positioning system in the Pepperl+Fuchs incident light process. The reader's features include a camera module and an integrated illumination unit. The reader uses these features to detect a colored strip stuck to the floor to track the lane. The reader also detects control codes and position markers in the form of Data Matrix codes attached to a self-adhesive code tape. The code tape is usually mounted in a fixed position instead of the colored strip or parallel to the colored strip. The reader is located on the front of an automated guided vehicle and guides this vehicle along the colored strip.
